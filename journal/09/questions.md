# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> Inheritance is when you 'extend' or 'inherit' from another class to obtain functionality within that class to build upon it, but not change that original base class.

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> A design pattern that has a single instance of a class that can't be changed publicly, but is publicly visible to be accessed through an application.

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> The observer pattern builds a relationship between two items. One item that is observing and one that is passively functioning and the observer will perform an action when the obvserved item changes.

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> Extracts behaviour into seperate classes that are called at runtime/as needed.

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> The factory design pattern involves having a base class to be inherited from or abstracted to share a series of functions where a result may have shared features and override them when necessary.

06. What is test driven development?

> Test driven development is when you write a test before writing a function so that you know your desired results and try to achieve it later.
