# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use git to help manage our projects, as it allows us to upload the current state of a project online. This lets us do a few things. It gives us more than one place to store a project, this is helpful in the case that our harddrive for our computer dies. Git being online is also much more convenient that say having an external harddrive and uploading the project to that. 
    
    Git also offers version control, allowing us to essentially roll back a project. So that in the off chance the project breaks beyond all comprehension we can simply go back to an older version of the project that wasn't broken.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > `mkdir` makes a new folder at the current location of the filepath in the command prompt.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A pseudo-class is like a special adjustment given to a selector for more control over interactions. I think "hover" and "required" will be used relatively often. "Hover" is great for giving the user that extra bit of feedback to know their interactions on a page are being received. "Required" makes a field required to move forward, great for anytime you need the user to input information such as a username/password to login to something.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is the internal value given to a css selector, telling the code which set of property styling instructions to prioritize over another.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    >  `!important` ignores rules of specificty to give priority of one over another. If used too often you could easily create a scenario where the feature becomes useless. Since if using `important` gives priority where it normally wouldn't be, giving it to both selectors will overwrite the functionality and return it to normal. This would cause a lot of unnecessary confusion, which is why it's recommended against using regularly.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > The Selector(what we're targeting), "h1"; The Property(what we're changing), "color"; and The Value(value of the property) "rgba(255, 210, 33, .75)"
