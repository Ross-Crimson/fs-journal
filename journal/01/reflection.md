# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with? I'd say my current biggest struggle is properly utilizing justify/flex in bootstrap. Alone it makes a lot of sense when building from scratch, but the bootstrap implimentation feels finicky at times. Like at points it seems to work great and others I struggle to get something to work. I'm not sure if that's me missing something, needing to overrwrite a peice of bootstrap css or some combination of both.
- What would you count as a victory?

## Notes
- command line: "touch" makes a file. index.html style.css
- "!" in html builds starting block content

- element type times a number will create that many. Ex: div*3 will create three subsequent div elements

- Windows: window key + '.' will open emojis in vs code
